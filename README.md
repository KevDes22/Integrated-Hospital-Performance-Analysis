## INTRODUCTION

The health sector is a crucial sector that needs to be properly examined, and the results should be documented. In the health sector, Data analysis plays a crucial role, as it transforms raw medical information into actionable insights that improve patient care and hospital management. By analyzing patient records and treatment histories, healthcare providers can identify patterns, predict disease outbreaks, and make evidence-based decisions for more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. It also helps in optimizing hospital resources, reducing operational costs, and ensuring timely interventions. On a broader scale, data analysis enables policymakers to monitor health trends, evaluate healthcare programs, and design effective strategies to address emerging challenges, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for individuals and communities. 

## METHODOLOGY

This project is a data analysis report on “HEALTH CARE”, it consists of three parts: patient segmentation, revenue analysis, and doctor performance for one year. The analysis encompasses a descriptive and diagnostic data analysis approach.
The first step involved in curating this project is data collection. The collection was from the Kaggle website. Power BI tool was secondly used for data transformation, visualization, and building three data dashboards for insight findings. PowerPoint presentation slides were also used for report writing.
### KEY METHODOLOGIES APPLIED INCLUDE:
1.	**PATIENTS SEGMENT ANALYSIS:**
- Trend Analysis: Monthly registration patterns of patients were examined to understand the count of patients fully registered in the hospital book file.
-	Segmentation Analysis: Patients were segmented by age group, gender, treatment type, and insurance provider to identify dominant groups.
-	Cards: Fully registered Patients were counted in the record book. 
-	Comparative Analysis: Gender composition and age-based treatment types were compared to detect differences in healthcare access or operation.
2.	**REVENUE ANALYSIS**
-	KPI Cards: This shows the total sum of the revenue generated for a year. The figure includes all payment statuses from successful transactions to pending and failed transactions
-	Descriptive Analysis: Measured total revenue, monthly profit, and payment breakdown.
-	Diagnostic Analysis: Explored why revenue differs across gender, treatments, and age groups.
-	Trend Analysis: Examined month-by-month revenue patterns to detect seasonal fluctuations in the year 2023.
-	Segmentation Analysis: Revenue segmented by patient demographics (age, gender) and treatments.
-	Contribution Analysis: Identified the top 10 patients contributing the most revenue.


3.	**DOCTOR PERFORMANCE**
-	Descriptive Analysis: Summarized appointment counts, treatments delivered, and revenue generated by each doctor.
-	Diagnostic Analysis: Compared variations across doctors to understand why some outperform others.
-	Segmentation: Doctors segmented by type of treatment administered (Chemotherapy, ECG, MRI, Physiotherapy, X-Ray).
-	Performance Metrics: Evaluated based on appointment outcomes (completed vs cancelled/no-shows).
-	Revenue Contribution: Examined doctor-specific revenue generation to assess financial impact.


## DATA MODELLING

The sections describe the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the project healthcare management. It represents five key entities: BILLING, TREATMENT, APPOINTMENT, PATIENTS, and DOCTORS. Each entity consists of a list of corresponding attributes (e.g., amount in BILLING, first_name in PATIENTS, specialization in DOCTORS). The lines connecting the entities, along with the crow's foot notation (like the '1' and '*', or 'many' symbols), illustrate the relationships between them and their cardinality. For instance, an APPOINTMENT is linked to one PATIENT, one DOCTOR, and one or many TREATMENTS, which, in turn, relates to a BILLING record. This structured model defines the tables, columns, and relationships required to manage patient, doctor, appointment, treatment, and financial data within the system.

-	gender_category → Male or Female revenue contribution.
-	month → Month of revenue generation.
-	payment_status → Payment outcome (Paid, Pending, Failed).
  
## DATA CLEANING 
Before visualization and analysis, the dataset underwent cleaning steps to ensure accuracy:
- 	Missing Values Handling: checked for missing values and columns. Added an age column using the DAX datedif function to calculate age from the patient's date of birth and group each age into intervals (30-39, 40-49,… 70-79). 
-	 Data types Validation: validated all columns to be in the right data type format.
-	Calculated measures: used DAX to create measures for total revenue and average age.
  
## RESULTS
### PATIENTS SEGMENT ANALYSIS

#### DESCRIPTIVE INSIGHTS
-	Total Revenue: The hospital generated $551.25K during the period, with a monthly profit of $27.57K, exceeding its target.
-	Revenue by Gender: Females contributed 65.52% ($361.2K), while males generated 34.48% ($190.05K), consistent with higher female patient visits in the patient analysis.
-	Revenue Trend: Revenue peaked around April–June, followed by a dip in September, suggesting seasonal or operational impacts.
-	Payment Status: A notable share of revenue is still pending or failed, indicating gaps in billing or collections that need attention.
-	Revenue by Age Group: The 30–39 and 50–59 groups generated the highest revenue, aligning with patient treatment demand in those age brackets.
-	Revenue by Treatment Type: ECG and Chemotherapy dominate revenue streams, while Physiotherapy and MRI contribute less, reflecting service utilization patterns.
-	Top 10 Patients: A small set of patients (IDs P049, P050, P047, etc.) contribute disproportionately to total revenue, showing the importance of key clients.

#### Diagnostic Insights:
-	The higher male contribution to revenue correlates with their higher hospital visits from the Patient Analysis dashboard.
-	Seasonal peaks may be linked to increased demand for certain treatments during specific months (e.g., cancer screenings, health checkups).
-	High pending/failed payments highlight the need for stronger billing and insurance claim management.
-	Revenue concentration in ECG and Chemotherapy implies reliance on a limited set of services, which could pose financial risk if demand shifts.

### DOCTOR PERFORMANCE

- Diagnostic Insights:
- Sarah Taylor’s high revenue aligns with her high number of appointments and successful completion rate, explaining her dominance.
-	The high no-show rate across doctors suggests patient follow-up and reminder systems need improvement.
-	Doctors with lower appointment counts (e.g., Robert Davis, Linda Brown) may either be specialists in less-demanded treatments or underutilized, requiring management review.
-	Chemotherapy and Physiotherapy dominate, reflecting treatment demand trends that could guide future staffing and training.
  
### RECOMMENDATIONS

1.	Hospital should expand their services across other health-related issues, employ doctors with different specializations, and try to upgrade tools and utilize resources, x ray services, MRI
2.	Deploy a health reminder assistant that will send emails to patients reminding them of their appointment.
3.	The hospital should try deploying a trust wallet for committed patients, so that each month, a certain amount is deducted from the wallet to cover  their health expenses
4.	The hospital should have a partner relationship with insurance health providers
5.	Host a seminar for younger children on good health living because the most dominant age group for hospital constant visits is age 30-39 
6.	Sponsor doctors to learn other specialized fields to boost the service capacity of the hospital.
